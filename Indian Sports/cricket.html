    Cricket has been the most popular sport in India, it is played almost everywhere in the country and a prominent part
    of the country.The Board of Control for cricket in India (BCCI) is the governing body of Indian cricket and conduct 
    all domestictournaments and select the players for India national cricket team and India women'snational cricket 
    team.

    Hazare Trophy, the Deodhar Trophy,the Irani Trophy anticipatedthe NKP Salve Challenger Trophy. The Indian Premier
    League, a Twenty20 tournament where various city-based franchises compete in a style similar to American football,
    is one of the biggest sporting leagues and the biggest cricketing league in the world. In 2023 it launched a similar

    cricket in India does not follow a consistent pattern, unlike other cricketing teams such as England,
    who tour other countries during the winter and play at home during the summer. The Indian cricket team is one of the
    most successful cricket teams in the world, having won 2 ICC World Cups, 1 ICC World Twenty20, 2 ICC Champion's 
    troffies and finished runners up in the inaugural edition of the ICC World Test Championship. The 2021 ICC Men's T20
    World Cup, was initially meant to be hosted by India. However, after the escalation of the COVID-19 Pandemic in India,
    the tournament was moved by the ICC to the United Arab Emirates. The 2023 Cricket World Cup will be hosted by India.


    Indian cricketers association is the country's retired cricketer's union. It is recognized by BCCI,but the latter do 
    not allow any active player to be part of it or any other players union. BCCI keep ICA's representative in its and 
    IPL's apex council.


    Cricket is an important part of Indian culture  and top players, like Sachin Tendulkar, Sourav Ganguly,Virat Kohli, MS
    Dhoni and Rohit Sharma often attain celebrity status and are some of the most influential figures in the country. Cricket
    is often portrayed patriotically in popular Indian films, including the Academy Award-nominated film, Lagaan, and 83, the
    2021 sports drama film about India's Cricket World Cup victory in 1983. The Indian team shares a long-standing rivalry with
    the Pakistani team, and India-Pakistan matches are some of the most anticipated matches in the world, and one of the most
    watched television broadcasts in the world.<hr>
    
    <h1><u><i>HISTORY</i></u></h1>
    <p>The British brought cricket to the Indian subcontinent in the early 1700s, with the first documented instance of cricket 
    being played is in 1721.It was played and adopted by Kolis of Gujarat because they were sea pirates and outlaws who used 
    to loot the British ships.East India Company tried to manage the Kolis using cricket and were successful.</p>

    <h1 style="font-size: xx-large;"><u>1800s to 1918</u></h1>
    <p>
    he first ever match of first-class cricket played in India was in 1864 between Calcutta and Madras. Not many records exist
    from the match. The entire history of cricket in India and the sub-continent as a whole is based on the existence and 
    development of the British Raj via the East India Company.</p>

    <h1 style="font-size: xx-large;"><u>1918 to 1945</u></h1>
    <p>
    India became a member of the 'elite club' joining Australia, England, South Africa, New Zealand and the West Indies in June
    1932. India's first match in Lord's against England attracted a massive crowd of 24,000 people as well as the King of the 
    United Kingdom.</p>

    <h1 style="font-size: xx-large;"><u>11945 to 1960</u></h1>
    <p>
    he major and defining event in the history of Indian cricket during this period was the Partition of India following full
    independence from the British Raj in 1947.
    
    An early casualty of change was the Bombay Quadrangular tournament, which had been a focal point of Indian cricket for over
    50 years. The new India had no place for teams based on ethnic origin. As a result, the Ranji Trophy came into its own as 
    national championship. The last Bombay Pentangular, as it had become, was won by the Hindus in 1945–46.</p>

    <h1 style="font-size: xx-large;"><u>1160 to 1985</u></h1>
    <p>
    Bombay continued to dominate Indian domestic cricket, with only Karnataka, Delhi, and a few other teams able to mount any kind
    of challenge during this period.

    India enjoyed two international highlights. In 1971, they won a Test series in England for the first time ever, surprisingly 
    defeating Ray Illingworth's Ashes winners. In 1983, again in England, India were surprise winners of the 1983 Cricket World Cup 
    under the captaincy of Kapil Dev.

    During the 1970s, the Indian cricket team began to see success overseas beating New Zealand, and holding Australia, South Africa
    and England to a draw. The backbone of the team was the Indian spin quartet – Bishen Bedi, E. A. S. Prasanna, B. S. Chandrasekhar 
    and Srinivas Venkataraghavan, giving rise to what would later be called the Golden Era of Indian cricket history. This decade also 
    saw the emergence of two of India's best ever batsmen, Sunil Gavaskar and Gundappa Vishwanath responsible for the back-to-back series 
    wins in 1971 in the West Indies and in England, under the captaincy of Ajit Wadekar.</p>

    <p>
    Since 2000, the Indian team underwent major improvements with the appointment of John Wright, India's first ever foreign coach. This
    appointment met success internationally as India maintained their unbeaten home record against Australia in Test series after defeating
    them in 2001 and won the inaugural ICC World Twenty20 in 2007. India was also the first sub-continental team to win at the WACA in 
    January 2008 against Australia.

    India's victory against the Australians in 2001 marked the beginning of a dream era for the team under the captainship of Sourav Ganguly,
    winning Test matches in Zimbabwe, Sri Lanka, West Indies and England. India also shared a joint victory with Sri Lanka in the ICC Champions
    Trophy and went on to the finals in the 2003 Cricket World Cup only to be beaten by Australia.

    India won the Cricket World Cup in 2011 under the captainship of Mahendra Singh Dhoni,[8] the first time since 1983 (28 years) – they beat 
    Sri Lanka in the final held in Mumbai's Wankhede Stadium.

    India played its 500th Test match against New Zealand led by Kane Williamson at Kanpur from 22 - 26 September 2016.[11] India won this match 
    by 197 runs. This test was played under the captaincy of Virat Kohli.

    Currently, they are first in the 2019-21 ICC World Test Championship with 490 points and a PCT (percentage of points) of 71.They will play 
    their final test in the 2019-21 ICC World Test Championship (which is also the final test in the 2021 Anthony De Mello Trophy) They played 
    in their first series of the 2020-22 ICC Cricket World Cup Super League against the Australia national cricket team winning only one match
    and being fined 1 point for a slow over rate having only 9 points and being seventh in the league.</b>
