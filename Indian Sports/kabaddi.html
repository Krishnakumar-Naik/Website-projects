    Kabaddi (also known as Kaudi) is a contact team sport played between two teams of seven players. The objective of the game is for 
    a single player on offense, referred to as a "raider", to run into the opposing team's half of the court, touch out as many of 
    their players and return to their own half of the court, all without being tackled by the defenders in 30 seconds. Points are 
    scored for each player tagged by the raider, while the opposing team earns a point for stopping the raider. Players are taken out 
    of the game if they are touched or tackled, but are brought back in for each point scored by their team from a tag or a tackle.

    It is popular in the Indian subcontinent and other surrounding Asian countries. Although accounts of kabaddi appear in the 
    histories of ancient India, the game was popularised as a competitive sport in the 20th century. It is the national sport of 
    Bangladesh.[2] It is the state game of the Indian states of Andhra Pradesh, Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Haryana, Karnataka, Kerala, 
    Maharashtra, Odisha, Punjab, Tamil Nadu,Telangana, and Uttar Pradesh.

    There are two major disciplines of kabaddi: "Punjabi kabaddi", also referred to as "circle styles", comprises traditional forms 
    of the sport that are played on a circular field outdoors, while the "standard style", played on a rectangular court indoors, is 
    the discipline played in major professional leagues and international competitions such as the Asian Games.

    This game is known by numerous names in different parts of the Indian subcontinent, such as: kabaddi or chedugudu in Andhra 
    Pradesh and Telangana; kabaddi in Maharashtra, Karnataka and Kerala; kabaddi, komonti or ha-du-du in West Bengal and Bangladesh; 
    baibalaa in Maldives, kauddi or kabaddi in the Punjab region; hu-tu-tu in Western India, ha-do-do in Eastern India; chadakudu in 
    South India; kapardi in Nepal; kabadi or sadugudu in Tamil Nadu; and chakgudu in Sri Lanka.</p><hr>

       <h1><i><u>HISTORY</u></i></h1>

    <p>Kabaddi is a sport developed centered on Jallikattu. It was common among the Ayar tribal people who lived in the Mullai 
    geographical region of ancient Tamil Nadu.A player going to the opposition is treated like a Bull. It is like taming a bull 
    without touching it, as it is mentioned in Sangam Literature that the game called Sadugudu was practised since ages. There are 
    also accounts of Gautam Buddha having played the game recreationally.According to another version of this sport's origins, kabaddi
    originated in Tamil Nadu over 4,000 years ago.

    The game was said to have been popular among the Yadava people. An Abhang by Tukaram stated that the lord Krishna played the game 
    in his youth.
       
    Modern kabaddi is a synthesis of the game played in various forms under different names in the Indian subcontinent.India has been 
    first credited with having helped to popularise kabaddi as a competitive sport, with the first organized competitions occurring in
    the 1920s,their introduction to the programme of the Indian Olympic Games in 1938, the establishment of the All-India Kabaddi 
    Federation in 1950,and it being played as a demonstration sport at the inaugural 1951 Asian Games in New Delhi. These developments
    helped to formalize the sport, which had traditionally beenplayed in villages, for legitimate international competition.
       
    After being demonstrated again at the 1982 Asian Games in Delhi, Kabaddi was added to the Asian Games programme beginning in 1990.</p><hr>

        <h1><i><u>STANDARD STYLE</u></i></h1>

    <p>In the international team version of kabaddi, two teams of seven members each occupy opposite halves of a court of 10 by 13 metres 
    (33 ft × 43 ft)in case of men and 8 by 12 metres (26 ft × 39 ft) in case of women.Each has five supplementary players held in 
    reserve for substitution.[13] The game is played with 20-minute halves with a 5-minute half time break in which the teams exchange
    sides. During each play, known as a "raid",a player from the attacking side, known as the "raider", runs into the opposing team's 
    side of the court and attempts to tag as many of the seven defending players as possible. The raider must cross the baulk line 
    into the defending team's territory, and then return to their half of the fieldwithout being tackled. (If an attacker touches a 
    defender and hasn't yet reached the baulk line, they do not need to reach the baulk line to score points and may return to their
    half of the court.)While raiding, the raider must loudly chant kabaddi, confirming to referees that their raid isdone on a single 
    breath without inhaling. Each raid has a 30-second time limit.<br>

    A point is scored for each defender tagged; tags can be made with the raider's hand or foot.If the raider steps beyond the bonus 
    line marked in the defending team's territory when there are five or more players, they earn an additional point known as a bonus 
    point. If the raider is successfully stopped (tackled), the opposite team earns a point instead. All players tagged are taken out 
    of the game, but one is "revived" for each point a team scores from a subsequent tag or tackle. Bonus points do not revive players.<br>
    Players who step out of the boundary are out. A raid where no points are scored by the raider is referred to as an "empty raid".By
    contrast, a play where the raider scores three or more points is referred to as a "super raid". If a team gets all seven players
    on the opposing team out at once ("All Out"), they earn two additional points and the players are placed back in the game.</p><hr>

        <h1><i><u>CIRCLE STYLE</u></i></h1>

    <p>There are four major forms of Indian kabaddi recognised by the amateur federation.In Sanjeevani kabaddi, one player is revived
    against one player of the opposite team who is out. The game is played over 40 minutes with a five-minute break between halves.
    There are seven players on each side and the team that outs all the players on the opponent's side scores four extra points.<br>

    In Gaminee style, seven players play on each side and a player put out has to remain out until all his team members are out.
    The team that is successful in outing all the players of the opponent's side secures a point. The game continues until five or
    seven such points are secured and has no fixed time duration.<br>

    Amar style resembles the Sanjeevani form in the time frame rule, but a player who is declared out stays inside the court while
    play continues. For every player of the opposition touched "out", a team earns a point.<br>

    Punjabi kabaddi is a variation that is played on a circular pitch of a diameter of 22 metres (72 ft).</p><hr>

        <h1><i><u>KABADDI WORLD CUP</u></i></h1>

    <p>The Kabaddi World Cup is an outdoor international standard style kabaddi competition conducted by the International Kabaddi
    Federation (IKF), contested by men'sand women's national teams. The competition has been previously contested in 2004, 2007 
    and 2016. All the tournaments have been won by India. India defeated Iranby 38–29 in the final of the championship game to 
    clinch the title of 2016.<br>

    After the establishment of a new kabaddi organization named World Kabaddi Federation, a 2019 Kabaddi World Cup was held in April
    2019 at Malacca, Malaysia. It was the largest world cup in kabaddi history, consisting of 32 men's teams and 24 women's teams.

        <h1><i><u>PRO KABADDI LEAGUE</u></i></h1>

    <p>The Pro Kabaddi League was established in 2014.The league modeled its business upon that of the Indian Premier League of
    Twenty20 cricket, with a large focuson marketing, the backing of local broadcaster Star Sports, and changes to the sport's rules
    and its presentation to make it more suitable for a television audience.The Pro Kabaddi League quickly became a ratings success
    on Indian television; the 2014 season was watched by at least 435 million viewers over the course of the 
    season, and the inaugural championship match was seen by 98.6 million viewers.<br><br>

    All players in the league must be strictly under 85 kg of weight.<br>
        
    Additional rules are used in the Pro Kabaddi League to encourage scoring: when a defensive side has three or fewer players
    remaining, tackles are worth two points instead of one. Furthermore, if a team performs two empty raids in a row, the next raider
    must score a point, or else they will be declared out and the opposing teamwill score a point.</p><hr>
