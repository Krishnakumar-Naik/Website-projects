    Football in India is among the three most popular sports in terms of player participation and TV viewership, together with Cricket
    and kabaddi.  India's top domestic competition is the Indian Super League, formed with eight teams in 2014, recognised by the AFC 
    as the national football league he Santosh Trophy is a knock-out competition between Indian states and government institutions.

    The Under-17 World Cup was hosted by India in 2017, the first FIFA event the country hosted. It was touted as the most successful
    FIFA U-17 World Cup ever, with the attendance, a record 1,347,133, surpassing China's 1,230,976 in 1985. India also hosted the 2022
    FIFA U-17 Women's World Cup and bid to host the 2019 FIFA U-20 World Cup, but lost to Poland.</p><hr><br>

            <h1><u><i>HISTORY</i></u></h1>

    <p>The origin of football in India can be traced back to mid-nineteenth century when the game was introduced by British soldiers
    Initially, games were played between army teams. However, clubs were soon set up around the country. Calcutta FC was the first club
    to be established in 1872, though reports suggest that they were initially a rugby club and switched their attentions to football as
    late as 1894. Other early clubs include Dalhousie Club, Traders Club and Naval Volunteers Club Several other football clubs like 
    Sovabazar, Mohun Bagan and Aryan Club were established in Calcutta around the 1890s. Calcutta, then capital of British India, soon
    became the hub of Indian football. Tournaments like Gladstone Cup, Trades Cup and Cooch Behar Cup were also started around this time
    The Durand Cup and IFA Shield were both started in late nineteenth century.

    The first Indian team to achieve success was Sovabazar Club, which won the Trades Cup in 1892. Mohun Bagan Athletic Club was set up in
    what is now West Bengal in 1889. The club became famous in 1911 when it became the first Indian team to lift the IFA Shield, a tournament
    previously won only by British teams based in India. It defeated the East Yorkshire Regiment 2–1 in the final of the tournament in a
    victory that is still regarded by many as the greatest win by an Indian team before Independence.

    The Indian Football Association (IFA) was established in Calcutta in 1893, but did not have a single Indian on its board until the 1930s.
    The All India Football Federation, which runs the game in India, was formed in 1937, but took more than a decade to get affiliated with 
    FIFA. India also insisted on playing barefoot when other nations were putting their boots on and the game was changing fast. Legendary 
    footballer Jyotish Chandra Guha earned global attention for Indian football when he became first Indian to appear with English Football 
    League club Arsenal in 1930.</p><hr>

            <h1><u><i>THE GOLDEN AGE</i></u></h1>

    <p>India qualified by default for the 1950 FIFA World Cup as a result of the withdrawal of all of their scheduled opponents. But lack of 
    financial assistance to purchase tickets including the prospects of a very long sea journey meant that the team never made it to Brazil.
    But this theory was debunked by sports journalist Jaydeep Basu, according to him, money generation for Brazil trip was a headache but it 
    was solved, 3 state associatios provided financial help to AIFF and FIFA also promised to provide money.FIFA had imposed a rule banning 
    barefoot play following the 1948 Olympics where India had played barefoot. The myth that Indians refused to play because they were not 
    allowed to play barefoot is not entirely true, according to the then Indian captain Shailen Manna, it was just a story to cover up the 
    disastrous decision of the AIFF. The team has never since come close to qualifying for the World Cup. AIFF also organised training for 
    the world cup at Calcutta, the board organised series of meetings but couldn't able to reach decision and finally 1, 2 weeks before of 
    World Cup, initiated giving lame excuses to abandon the world cup trip. In 1948 hardly anyone criticized AIFF to do this because FIFA 
    World Cup was not as big as it now.<br><br>

    India won the gold medal in the first Asian Games in 1951, beating a "booted" Iran by a solitary goal. In 1956, after having put on its
    boots, India reached the semi-final in 1956 Melbourne Olympics, the first Asian country to do so. It stood fourth in the tournament. In 
    1962, India again won the football gold in the Asian Games at Jakarta, team India defeated South Korea by 1–2 goal difference.
    1951–1962 is usually considered as "golden phase" of Indian football. The National team won numerous titles in this era under the coaching 
    of Syed Abdul Rahim. Other than success in Asian Games football, India also won Merdeka Cup and Quadrangular Tournament while East Bengal 
    garnered rave reviews after its tour of Romania. It is during this period that India achieved their highest World Football Elo Ratings of 
    31 in 1951. Rahim's death in the early 1960s pegged Indian football back after a successful period. The former FIFA president Sepp Blatter
    once famously said that India is "the sleeping giant of world football".</p><hr>

           <h1><u><i>THE DECLINE</i></u></h1>

    <p>India never qualified for the Olympics after 1960. India did qualify for its first Asian Cup in 1964 but failed to capture the title. 
    India's last important performance in an international tournament came in 1970 Asian Games, when it won the bronze medal by defeating 
    Japan 1–0, however the Indian youth team jointly won the Youth Asian Cup with Iran in 1974, the first and only title for India at youth 
    level. For the club football, 24 September 1977 was a golden day as Mohun Bagan managed to hold on for a memorable 2–2 draw at the 
    legendary Eden Gardens stadium in Calcutta, against a Pele led New York Cosmos. Mohun Bagan would have gone on and won the tie, had it 
    not been for a controversial penalty awarded to the visitors that ensured the spoils were shared. The next day, the Ananda Bazar Patrika 
    described Goutam Sarkar as "India's very own Beckenbaur". The Indian national team qualified for the 1984 AFC Asian Cup for the first time 
    since 1964, but failed to qualify for knockout stage as they finished last in their group of five teams. After a golden phase in 1950s and 
    1960s, Indian football went through a barren phase in the later years, gradually losing its foothold as a top Asian team.<br><br>

    However, things were just getting started for the women's team as they began playing in the 1970s. Their first manager was Sushil Bhattacha
    -rya, in 1975.  The Indian women's team went on to finish as runners-up in 1980 and 1983 editions of AFC Women's Asian Cup. Later in the 
    1990s, the women's team declined rapidly and a series of defeats with heavy margins followed. In 2009, the women's team reached its all-time 
    low as they were delisted by FIFA in world rankings. <br><br>
    
    In August 2007, the Indian national team won the Nehru Cup for the first time in its history beating Syria 1–0. In August the following year,
    India defeated Tajikistan 4–1 to lift the AFC Challenge Cup and in turn qualified for the 2011 AFC Asian Cup in Qatar. In August 2009, India
    again won the Nehru Cup beating Syria on penalties (6–5).</p> <hr>

          <h1><u><i>2011-PRESENT</i></u></h1>

    <p>In January 2011 India played in the 2011 Asian Cup which was the first time India has played in the Asian Cup for 24 years. India were knocked 
    out in the group stage which contained South Korea, Australia, and Bahrain.<br>

    Ever since the 2011 Asian Cup the All India Football Federation has been working very hard on Indian Football. For instance they allowed former 
    coach Bob Houghton coach the Indian side in the 2012 AFC Challenge Cup qualifiers. After going first in there AFC Challenge Cup group Bob 
    Houghton was sacked and replaced by Wim Koevermans. Meanwhile, the India national under-23 football team won the first round of the 2012 Olympics 
    qualifiers against Myanmar but were knocked out by Qatar. India played their next official matches against United Arab Emirates in the 2014 FIFA 
    World Cup qualifiers which India lost on aggregate 5–2.<br>
    In 2018 Indian youth football teams created history by defeating Argentina U20 2–1 on Cotif Cup, and Iraq U16, the defending champions of AFC U-16 
    Championship, by 1–0. The U-16 team qualified for the 2018 AFC U-16 Championship where they came close to qualify for 2019 FIFA U-17 World Cup, but 
    went down to South Korea by solitary goal in quarterfinals.Indian senior national team qualified for the 2019 edition Asian Cup after missing out in 
    2015. In that tournament, India beat Thailand by 4–1; their biggest ever win at the Asia Cup, and their first in 55 years.Nevertheless, they lost 
    both of their next two group matches against UAE and Bahrain by 0−2 and 0−1 respectively and finished at the bottom of the group, thus failed to move 
    to knock out stage.</p><hr>

          <h1><u><i>NATIONAL TEAM</i></u></h1>

    <p>The India national football team is the national football team of India and is governed by the All India Football Federation. It is a member of the 
    Asian Football Confederation. Since 1948, the AIFF has been affiliated with FIFA, the international governing body for world football. In 1954, AIFF 
    became one of the founder members of the Asian Football Confederation (AFC). In 1948 Olympics team India showed impressive game.<br>

    At the peak of its success during the 1950s and 60s, the team was automatically advanced to play in the 1950 FIFA World Cup (all the other Asian teams 
    withdrew), but ultimately they did not go to the tournament in Brazil due to the cost of travel, lack of practice time, team selection issues, the 
    issue of the AIFF valuing Olympics over the World Cup, and, unusually, their insistance on playing barefoot when FIFA required all players to wear 
    football boots. They won gold medals at two Asian Games in 1951 and 1962, and held the record for the best performance by an Asian football team at the 
    Olympics, it reached till semifinal of 1956 Olympics.<br>

    There are also a number of other national teams from the Under-23 team to the Under-17 team, the under-23's is considered to be a feeder team for the 
    national team.</p><hr>

        <h1><u><i>STADIUMS</i></u></h1>

    <p>There are many football stadiums in India, however only a few of them are currently of world standards. These are namely the largest stadium in India,
    the Salt Lake Stadium in Kolkata with a seating capacity of 85,000, Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium in New Delhi with a capacity of over 60,000 and the 
    Ambedkar Stadium with a capacity of 35,000. Barabati Stadium in Cuttack and Kalinga Stadium in Bhubaneswar are two major arenas for football events in 
    Odisha. In Sikkim, the 30,000-capacity Paljor Stadium in Gangtok is famous as one of the most beautiful stadiums in the world as it is situated in the
    backdrop of Himalayas. In Shillong the main stadium is the Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium with a capacity of 30,000 standing. Both the Paljor and the JLN in
    Shillong have been renovated and now have artificial playing surfaces. Some other stadiums important stadiums are the Shree Shiv Chhatrapati Sports 
    Complex in Pune, the Barasat Stadium in Barasat, the Fatorda in Goa, the Kaloor International Stadium in Kochi, Municipal Corporation Stadium in 
    Kozhikode, the Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium in Guwahati, the EKA Arena in Ahmedabad. Apart from the above-mentioned stadiums, there are hundreds of more 
    stadiums in the country. The following stadiums are affiliated by All India Football Federation.</p><hr>

    
        <h1><u><i>WOMEN'S FOOTBALL</i></u></h1>

    <p>Women's football has not had the relative head start over the rest of the world that the men's game has had, and also has not had the chance to spread 
    through the country like its male counterpart. The game was administered by the Women's Football Federation of India (WFFI) from 1975 until the early 
    1990s when they were absorbed into the AIFF. However, there are complaints that women's football is treated as a poor relation to the men's game leading
    to (unfulfilled) plans to de-merge the WFFI.<br><br>

    The women's game, like the men's game, also has its early pioneers in the state of West Bengal. The large Kolkata teams, East Bengal and Mohun Bagan, 
    started women's club sides in the 2000–01 season, and they participate with other teams in the Calcutta Women's Football League. However, it has been 
    seen that players from Odisha and Manipur have made advances in the game. Players from these two states make up a large part of the India women's 
    natioonal football team. There are also similar national championships for junior teams like the Junior Girls National Championship (for under 19s) and 
    the Under-17 Girls National Championship.<br><br>

    Some female players have become internationally recognised. Among them are Chitra Gangadharan who was selected to play for the All Asian Star team. 
    Jaanki Kotecha was selected as captain to the All Asian Star Team in 2008–09, where she led her team to victory. In February 2000, Sujata Kar and Alpana 
    Sil became the first Indian footballers to sign a contract outside India. They signed with the German team TSV Crailsheim, but had to return after a month 
    due to problems with the clearance of their international transfer.<br><br>

    Until 1983, women's football took part in international tournaments like the AFC Women's Asian Cup. For example, the team won silver in 1980 at Calicut. In 
    later years, it had become poor in status just like its male counterpart. During the 2003 AFC Women's Championship, the Indian team were embarrassed by a 
    12–0 defeat to China.<br><br>

    The women's game reached a new low in June 2009 when FIFA delisted the side from its world rankings for being out of action for more than 18 months. This 
    comes at a time when the game was gaining in popularity amongst the younger generation as evident by the local leagues conducted around the country. The 
    recently concluded Mumbai Women's Football League 2009–10 organised by the MDFA (Mumbai District Football Association) was a major success and featured many 
    talented players who had played for the national team. Furthermore, the popularity of the event gave hope that the women's game could rise in India.
    The women's national competition is played on a state VS state basis in the India women's football championship.</p><hr>

        <h1 ><u><i>INDIAN WOMEN'S LEAGUE</i></u></h1>

    <p>On 21 April 2016, over a year after the AIFF started plans for a women's football league, the AIFF President, Praful Patel, said that a women's football
    league would kick off in October 2016 with six teams to be decided, with the goal to expand to eight teams by 2017. Just over two months later, on 5 July
    2016, the AIFF organized a workshop to discuss the India women's national team and discuss the proposed women's football league. Five Indian Super League
    sides (Delhi Dynamos, Chennaiyin FC, Kerala Blasters, FC Pune City, Atletico de Kolkata) and three I-League teams (Bengaluru FC, Aizawl FC, Mumbai FC)
    attended the workshop. It was announced that the league would feature the eight teams in the league and two other spots would be determined through a 
    pre-qualification round.<br><br>

    On 14 October, the AIFF announced that the preliminary rounds for the Women's League would begin on 17 October 2016 in which ten teams are split into two 
    groups of five teams each, with the winner from each group qualifying for the national finals.</p><hr>


        <h1 ><u><i>CONCLUSION</i></u></h1> 

      <p>
    In conclusion, football in India has witnessed significant progress and growth over the years. While cricket remains the nation's most popular sport, 
    football's rising popularity is evident through the success of leagues like the Indian Super League (ISL) and I-League, attracting both domestic and 
    international talent. The sport's increasing viewership, coupled with the emphasis on grassroots development and the establishment of football academies,
    has paved the way for the emergence of young talents. Efforts to improve infrastructure and training facilities have also contributed to the sport's 
    steady advancement. As a result, football is becoming an integral part of India's sporting culture, and the nation's performance on the international 
    stage continues to show promise.

    Despite the positive developments, challenges remain. Football faces tough competition from cricket, which has deep-rooted cultural significance in 
    India. Additionally, sustaining the momentum and further developing the sport will require ongoing investment and support from various stakeholders.
    Nevertheless, the overall trajectory of football in India appears promising, and with continued dedication, the sport has the potential to reach new 
    heights and make a significant impact on the country's sporting landscape.
